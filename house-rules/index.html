            <h2>Add Mr. Rando</h2>
            <p>Mr.Random was an entitiy created when there were only 3 players for Cards Against Humanity one night. Mr/MrsRandom would be a player, where every time the active player finished reading out the black card, we would take the top white card and that would be their answer. They dont have a hand, they just top deck. And to our surprise Mr.Random would win half the rounds...  This concept can be applied to other games, like Dixit, but obviously there needs to be some additional rules for the voting stage of that game. Ultimately, if Mr.Random wins the game, it would really show that maybe we werent as good at the game as we thought...</p>

            <h2>The Loser Wins</h2>
            <p>This is a great house rule for large parties or family games. Where whoever was in last place when the game ends, picks 2 boardgames, and then the rest of the players take a vote on what game to play next. This rule aims to make losing not feel as bad as it might sometimes. The only struggle is when you have a game like Pandemic...but dice are pretty good at picking someone random to choose!</p>

            <h2>Cocked die or not</h2>
            <p>This is less of a game altering rule, but it's a very relivant rule. How many times has there been arguments over if a die is tilted or not, and if it should be re-rolled? The answer can be put simply.</p>
            <q>Can you balance another die on top of it?</q>
            <p>if you can, you keep the roll, regardless if you want it or not. But if you can't re-roll it. Such a simple little mechanic to end all the little infights you might have around your table.</p>

            <p>If you take a card that you aren't legally able to take (not enough resources, already have a copy of in your tableau), you instead discard it for 3 coins. An easy fix for something that's easy for new players to forget.</p>

            <p>We didn't feel the game offered enough incentive for the Military track if you weren't gunning for an outright Military Victory, so we modified the rules such that whoever has the stronger military force at the beginning of each age chooses that age's start player once the cards are set. A subtle change, but it also made it feel a bit more thematic since a stronger military could help secure a powerful first-row card; at the least, it makes for a little bit more intriguing choice when you're considering whether to build or sell the last one-point military card left in a round.</p>

            <p>1st time players can't be the traitor. If the haunt happens and it turns out the new player is the traitor, we just ignore it and pretend like it didn't happen. Typically the next player to draw an omen will trigger another haunt anyways. We've found it keeps them from feeling overwhelmed and they can contribute as a part of the "heroes" team as they learn the game.</p>

            <p>We make it illegal for a player to place a cloister adjacent to a cloister they already control. Otherwise the double-cloister play (which is dependent entirely on luck of the draw) can be game-breaking in its efficiency. A minor thing but helps the game feel more balanced.</p>

            <h4>Token trade</h4>
            <p>Whenever you get nothing from a roll, take a token. On your turn, trade tokens for resources at the rate equal to the number of your visible vps (i.e. at game start it's two tokens per resource card). This really speeds up the early game and reduces the factor of luck, especially if you play with dice, not event cards or app that simulates them.</p>

            <h4>Ultimate Robber</h4>
            <p>When you move the robber, instead of just moving them and placing it ontop of a number marker in another tile, you would SWAP the robber with the number tile instead. Essentially, this means the first time someone moves the robber, a number tile is moved into the desert, and the robber now stands on an empty octagon. This not only causes some real heart ache, but also adds a new depth to moving the robber around... and adds another 20 minutes to every game you play.</p>

            <p>Have the opposing spymaster reveal cards for the guessing team. Too often, the clue-giving spymaster's hesitations makes it clear that the team was choosing an unintended (but valid) card, basically giving them extra hint.</p>

            <p>Deal 3 flares to each player instead of 2 for Cosmic Encounter. Everyone picks one alien to be, one to discard and the remaining flare goes in the deck so the 2 flares / player rule is maintained.</p>

            <p>We also have retired each alien after it gets chosen as a main player until we see them all.</p>

            <p>You can choose to take neither of the aliens dealt to you and you just draw the next cars and you are stuck with it. Makes for a bit of a gamble.</p>

            <h4>No Halves</h4>
            <p>If you are playing the advanced game, either don't use the advanced combat, Fremen losing one of their bonuses. Or make the non-suplied units' power = 0, thus making Fremen stronger. Calculating in halves tends to be quite burdensome. You can use doubled power - i.e. a supplied regular troop = 2, and a supplied Sardukar = 4, but then leaders become weaker or they have to be doubled as well, making the calculations difficult again.</p>

            <p>Put some more stuff in the box, so people have something to clutter with. I put in like 5 more pokerchips. Now the clatter can continue! Clatter even if you have nothing to take from the box. That way there won't be any meta deducing "Oh she had nothing to clatter with, so that means she can't be x and y".</p>

            <p>Extra action in your turn you can do at any time: Discard your complete hand and draw that many cards from the deck minus 1, permanently shrinking your handsize, but maybe giving you better options than the crud you have on hand right now. This made the game a bit more flexible as we had games where one player just couldn't do anything for a few rounds, only having cards to move units in quadrants he had no units in.</p>

            <p>Vanilla Memoir doesn't have the rule to play any card as move a single unit, but we use that one too.</p>

            <p>Put everyone's name in a hat and draw names at the start. A player wins the game if they reach level 10 or if they have the name of the person who reaches level 10. If you draw your own name, you win by reaching level 7.</p>
            <p>This modification allows the cooperative element of Munchkin to mean something more, and since name drawing is kept secret, it adds a certain level of uncertainty as to player's intentions.</p>

            <h4>True Ghost variant</h4>
            <p>The ghost can only communicate by knocking on the table when each psychic asks whether their guess was correct, and otherwise must wear a mask (if one is available) to prevent any expressions or looks from giving anything away. One knock for "you're wrong" and two knocks for "you're correct".</p>

            <p>The psychic players cannot show their vision cards to anyone else. Instead, they must verbally describe what's on the card, as if they can only picture the vision in their head.</p>

            <p>When starting a new round we choose some big company (may be real, may be not) we are taking up resistance against. Then, when you are the leader, make up some way we are sabotaging them for your mission ("We are gonna poison the CEO's goldfish!", "Gonna steal all their steel reserves with just one pickup truck" etc). As you deal out the weapons, dedicate jobs if you want. This has given us much roleplay opportunity and feels a bit more fleshed out than just assigning everything without comment. Might distract from deduction though, be advised.</p>

            <p>All cards drawn do not have to be played immediately unless they are equipment or have a negative effect (like banana peel). But kept cards can be stolen by anything that steals equipment. And you can still only play cards on your turn as well so no using a card in response to someone stealing it.</p>
            <p>This adds 2 extra elements to the game - more strategy in when you play your cards and bluffing. In that you can bluff what your cards are to trick an opponent. It also adds some risk/reward in keeping a healing card to try to pass to a teammate and hope they can take it from you before an enemy does.</p>
